**1. Project Overview:**

This project analyzes 67,000+ global COVID-19 records using SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI. It identifies regional and temporal disease trends, computes severity indicators, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard with KPIs and geo-maps.

**2. Tech Stack:**

a. SQL – Data cleaning, transformations, trend analysis

b. Excel – Data preprocessing, pivot tables, conditional formatting

c. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Automated data pipelines, quick analysis

d. Power BI – Dashboard creation, DAX-based forecasting

**3. Data Source:**

Dataset: Kaggle – WHO COVID-19 Global Data

**4. Features & Highlights:**

a. Built a relational database for COVID-19 records and wrote SQL queries to extract trends.

b. Applied Excel functions (SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, IFERROR) for preprocessing and validation.

c. Created pivot tables and charts for quick exploration.

d. Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and geo-maps.

e. Applied DAX forecasting for projecting future growth and recovery rates.

f. Developed daily summary SQL views for seamless Power BI integration.



**5. Key Insights:**

a. Europe and the Americas reported the highest total cases.

b. Fatality rates varied, with some countries crossing 10% CFR.

c. Monthly case spikes corresponded with major COVID-19 waves.

d. Forecasting helped policy-level decision-making for healthcare resource allocation.


**5. Business Impact & Insights:**

1. Policy-Level Decision Support

a. The dashboard highlights regional spikes and trends, enabling policymakers to allocate resources (beds, oxygen, vaccines) to the most affected areas.

b. Forecasting with DAX provided early warnings about upcoming surges.

2. Healthcare Resource Allocation

a. CFR (Case Fatality Rate) analysis identified high-risk countries/regions, allowing governments and NGOs to prioritize critical supplies.

b. Regional comparisons supported balanced distribution of medical staff and emergency kits.

3. Public Awareness & Communication

a. Interactive charts simplified complex COVID-19 data, making it easier for health ministries to communicate risks to the public.

b. Clear KPIs helped media & healthcare campaigns present verified, digestible numbers.

4. Operational Efficiency

a. Automated pipelines in SQL and Excel reduced manual reporting errors.

b. Daily summary view ensured real-time updates in Power BI, cutting reporting time by hours.

5. Strategic Planning

a. Insights on monthly waves helped businesses and schools decide on lockdowns or reopening strategies.

b. Governments could plan budgets for healthcare, vaccination, and emergency responses more effectively.
