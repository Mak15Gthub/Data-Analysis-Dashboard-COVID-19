**1. Project Overview:**

This project analyzes 67,000+ global COVID-19 records using SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI. It identifies regional and temporal disease trends, computes severity indicators, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard with KPIs and geo-maps.

**2. Tech Stack:**

a. SQL – Data cleaning, transformations, trend analysis

b. Excel – Data preprocessing, pivot tables, conditional formatting

c. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Automated data pipelines, quick analysis

d. Power BI – Dashboard creation, DAX-based forecasting

**3. Data Source:**

Dataset: Kaggle – WHO COVID-19 Global Data

**4. Features & Highlights:**

a. Built a relational database for COVID-19 records and wrote SQL queries to extract trends.

b. Applied Excel functions (SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, IFERROR) for preprocessing and validation.

c. Created pivot tables and charts for quick exploration.

d. Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and geo-maps.

e. Applied DAX forecasting for projecting future growth and recovery rates.

f. Developed daily summary SQL views for seamless Power BI integration.



**5. Key Insights:**

a. Europe and the Americas reported the highest total cases.

b. Fatality rates varied, with some countries crossing 10% CFR.

c. Monthly case spikes corresponded with major COVID-19 waves.

d. Forecasting helped policy-level decision-making for healthcare resource allocation.
